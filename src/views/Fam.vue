    <h1>Hey, friend! I'm glad you're here ðŸ’•</h1>
    <p>
      No matter what anyone else says, I'm proud of you. You crushed it when you
      used React/Vue/Svelte/Ember/Angular/Framework of your choice here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't judge a project's success by if some rando online says it's good or
      not. The important thing is if you accomplished something. Maybe you
      learned something new. Maybe your new tool saves you 5 minutes once some
      time in the future. Or maybe you just enjoyed yourself for a bit.

      <strong>That's a win</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      And small wins build to big wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look forward to seeing what you accomplish ðŸ’•
    </p>
    <p>
      And just to spite the haters, here's a message loaded from Vuex Store:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      {{ this.$store.state.msgForTheFam }}
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: "Fam",
};
</script>

<style>
blockquote {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #5a5475;
}
</style>
